# Roadmap

Two different things live here, kept apart on purpose.

**CLI/UI parity** is the list of jobs you can only do today by typing a
command or editing JSON. Each one is fine for a technical user and is the
wrong first experience for anyone else, so each is a gap between "works for
the band" and "shippable".

**Not planned** is the list of things this deliberately will not do. It is
load-bearing: the reason this project exists is that every tool in the space
is a host with a set list bolted on, and the way it stays useful is by
refusing to become one.

---

## CLI / UI parity

Everything below is now reachable without a terminal. The CLI tools remain,
because they script and they are what CI runs, but nothing requires them.

| job | where it is in the UI |
|---|---|
| open or create a set list | start screen, with recents; remembered between runs |
| pick a device, map buses | edit → **audio** |
| validate the set (`btcheck`) | edit → **check**, and an issue clicks through to the song it is about |
| render to WAV (`btrender`) | edit → **check** → export |
| make a demo set (`--make-demo`) | start screen |
| list devices (`--list-devices`) | edit → **audio** |
| play (`btplay`) | the whole point of the thing |

Still only in `setlist.json` by hand: tempo maps for songs that change tempo,
and reordering tracks within a song. The format supports both; the editor does
not expose them yet.

## Other product gaps, not CLI-shaped

- **Hands-free control.** A set cannot currently be run without touching the
  laptop. MIDI in for a footswitch is Phase 4 and is the difference between
  usable and comfortable on stage.
- **Align view.** Waveform against a click grid, drag to nudge, audition a few
  bars against the click. `bt_peaks` is built and tested for it.
- **Remembering things.** Window size, last set list opened, last device. None
  of it persists.
- **ASIO.** Not blocking — the UMC404HD exposes a four-channel endpoint under
  WASAPI — but worth having for exclusive device access and lower latency.
- **A backup-laptop story.** The set list folder is deliberately copyable, but
  nothing helps you keep two machines in step.

## Not planned

Each of these is a thing a DAW does, and doing it would make this the kind of
tool it exists to avoid being.

- **Plugin hosting.** No VST, no AU. The moment this hosts plugins it is a
  host with a set list bolted on, which is the thing every competitor already
  is.
- **Recording.** It plays files. It does not capture anything.
- **Time-stretching or pitch-shifting.** Tempo is metadata that must match
  what is already in the stems. Changing it live means stretching every stem,
  which is a different product and a licensing problem.
- **Mixing beyond gain and mute.** No EQ, no compression, no sends. Stems
  arrive mixed; the desk does the rest.
- **Aggregating multiple audio devices.** Two devices means two clocks, and
  two clocks means drift. One interface, one clock.
- **Beat detection.** The BPM and first downbeat are written down when the
  stems are bought. Guessing them is a hard problem whose failures are
  invisible until a gig.

If these should be GitHub issues rather than a file, say so — the text is
ready to paste, and a file in the repository is the version that survives
without anyone remembering to file them.
